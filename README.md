### Objective:

**Given a review, determine whether the review is positive (rating of 4 or 5) or negative (rating of 1 or 2).**


> How to determine if a review is positive or negative?

We could use Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 can be cosnidered as a positive review. A rating of 1 or 2 can be considered as negative one. A review of rating 3 is considered nuetral and such reviews are ignored from our analysis. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review.
